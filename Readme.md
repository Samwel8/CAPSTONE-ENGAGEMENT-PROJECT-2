# Red Vs. Blue Team Project

## Capstone Engagement

## Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

In this project, as a Red Team, I engaged in attacking a vulnerable VM within my environment by ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As a Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during my Day 1 engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.

Here are some of the vulnerabilities to identify.

* Sensitive Data Exposure
* Unauthorized File Upload
* Remote Code Execution
* Brute Force Vulnerability
* Local File Inclusion
* Cross Site Scripting
* Code Injection
* SQL Injection
* Security Misconfiguration

### RED TEAM DAY 1

Step 1: Discover the IP address of the Linux server.

Step 2: Locate the hidden directory on the server.

Step 3: Brute force the password for the hidden directory.

Step 4: Crack the password hash.

Step 5: Connect to the server via WebDAV.

Step 6: Upload a PHP reverse shell payload.

Step 7: Find and capture the flag.

### BLUE TEAM Day 2

Step 1: Identify the Offensive Traffic.

Step 2: Find the Request for the Hidden Directory.

Step 3: Identify the Brute Force Attack.

Step 4: Find the WebDav Connection.

Step 5: Identify the Reverse Shell and meterpreter Traffic.
